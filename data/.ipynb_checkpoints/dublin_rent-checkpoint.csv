Main bedrooms with ensuite Fitted wardrobes in all bedrooms, Separate utility room with washer/dryer, Spacious balconies / terraces Recessed light fittings / chrome fittings in living/kitchen areas -Floor tiling in hallways Heated mirrors / Stylish well tiled bathrooms and ensuites Fully fitted high quality kitchens Exceptional sound insulation and air tightness award winning Low cost CHP central heating and ventilation from sustainable energy Heat Recovery/District Heating systems .Landscaped grounds ,Lifts serving all floors with external and entrance lobby Closed Circuit Televison. A centralised heating system and cold water storage solution have been installed and this results in more apartment space for the occupier which is not taken up by plant. Each unit has a district heating sub- station and this meters the energy used by the occupant to heat the apartment and generate hot water. While the boiler plant is not in the apartment each occupier can adjust the operating conditions they require. In tandem with this modern heating solution the apartments have been built with high levels of insulation and air tightness, both of which ensure that heating bills will be lowered. To maintain comfort in the apartments each unit is fitted with a heat recovery ventilation system. The air in the apartment is constantly cycled with stale damp air being removed and fresh outside air in added, in a controlled manner. The heating from the outgoing air stream is transferred across to the incoming fresh air and this greatly limits the heat losses to the space.
