Each unit has a district heating sub- station and this meters the energy used by the occupant to heat the apartment and generate hot water. While the boiler plant is not in the apartment each occupier can adjust the operating conditions they require. In tandem with this modern heating solution the apartments have been built with high levels of insulation and air tightness, both of which ensure that heating bills will be lowered. To maintain comfort in the apartments each unit is fitted with a heat recovery ventilation system. The air in the apartment is constantly cycled with stale damp air being removed and fresh outside air in added, in a controlled manner. The heating from the outgoing air stream is transferred across to the incoming fresh air and this greatly limits the heat losses to the space.
